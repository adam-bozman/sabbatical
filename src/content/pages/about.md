title: About Sabbatical
---
Sabbatical imports wine from small family vintners around the globe.  We bring you the unique flavors of a wine produced in a foreign climate, topography, and soil.  For example, not everyone has had, or will have, the opportunity to enjoy loose wine (vino sfuso) in Florence Italy.  Many vintners in this region of Tuscany produce and sell limited quantities of loose (unbottled) wine.  They do so on small parcels of land, often 25 acres or less.   Regardless of the size of their vineyards, Italians take the quality of the wines they produce very seriously.  Some family vintners have been making high quality wines in the same location since the Roman Empire first made land grants to their ancestors.  Sabbatical is pleased to provide you with a selection of these limited production and high quality wines at a price everyone can enjoy.

Currently, Sabbatical offers two single-grape varieties, a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.  Our Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Red Mountain Washington.  Hand picked grapes from the smallest and most prestigious appellation in Washington - it's a full bodied red wine with hints of black cherry flavor.  Meanwhile, our Merlot is a younger, more verbose counterpart.  Also from Red Mountain Washington, this batch brings out the dry, medium-palate presence of most Merlots - with a little bite at the finish.

While we continue working out the logistics of a tasting room and distribution, the best place to find us will be at the [Pullman Farmers Market](https://pullmanfarmersmarket.com/).  We'll be here every week for the 2022 season, and we plan to return in spring of 2023 with a Ros√© made from Sangioveses grapes imported from Tuscany (along with our flagship Cab and Merlot, of course).  We hope to see you soon, and please reach out with any questions!
