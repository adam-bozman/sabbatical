# Wine, First Steps - Labels
### Part 1 of the Series "Scrub to Sommelier"

Is it actually possible to judge a book by its cover?  Well, we're not sure - but you might be able to judge a bottle of wine by its label, at least we think so.  The evolution of wine, more specifically the evolution of wine marketing, has accelerated at an unprecedented rate over the last few decades.  Moreover, with increased accesibility to global favorites (e.g., Chianti and Malbec), the abundance of information and variation among wineries and vineyards has become - even for the experienced drinker - overwhelming.  This poses some issues for the would-be wine connoisseur - namely, how can you tell the difference between a good bottle and a bad bottle?

At Sabbatical, we don't want to name any wineries' bottles as 'bad bottles', but we recognize that different wines have different purposes.  Knowing this, any patron should first consider what they want out of their bottle of wine.  Whether it be a simple cooking wine, a sweet dessert wine, or a full-bodied glass to enjoy by itself, there's a wine for every occassion!  

## Enter, Our Favorite Sommelier

[André Hueston Mack](http://andremack.com/) has accumulated a wealth of knowledge in industry, not to mention his influence outside of those astringent oak smelling rooms (he's best known for expert interviews with celebrities like Kevin Hart).  Like André, we believe wine should be approachable - something to enjoy, stripped of pretension and prestige.  For centuries and accross continents, wine has been at the foundation of culture.  Like cooking, winemaking allows us to engage with people all over the world in ways we otherwise wouldn't have the chance to.  

Anthony Bourdain taught us that food tells a story, 
>The history of the world is on your plate.  All food is the expression of a long struggle and a long story.

An expression, we believe, that manifests itself in wine, too.  We'll let André go over the finer points of selecting a great bottle, and we hope you enjoy.  

As you watch, keep in mind these three things:

1. Grapes/Blends
2. Origin/Vineyard
3. Distribution

We hope this eases the intimidation of walking into a wine shope like the one pictured above.  

Cheers!
